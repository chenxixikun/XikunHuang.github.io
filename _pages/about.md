Hi, I am Xikun. Currently I am a Ph.D. student at [Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, CAS](http://english.amss.cas.cn/). I am focused on network generative models that can explain various real complex networks.

In 2014, I received a B.S. in Mathematics from [Jilin University](http://global.jlu.edu.cn/User/Index/index).

I am a football fan.
